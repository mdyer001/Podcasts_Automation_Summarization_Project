# Automated Podcast Summarization and Highlight Generation

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a system that efficiently summarizes podcasts and generates highlights. Through the transcription of audio to text and applying advanced NLP techniques, the system will extract key points, create concise summaries, and generate highlights. The highlights will provide a quick synopsis to help users decide whether to listen to a podcast episode. Our approach will leverage various tools such as Spotify's podcast dataset, cloud-based speech-to-text services, and cutting-edge NLP techniques to accomplish these tasks.

## Data Acquisition

We will use the Spotify Podcast API or a prebuilt Spotify podcast dataset that includes 100,000 podcast episodes and over 47,000 hours of raw audio. The Spotify API will allow us to retrieve relevant metadata and episode content, which is essential for identifying key points and creating summaries. The dataset will provide us with a diverse range of podcasts from various genres, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of our model.

## Speech-to-Text Conversion

For transcribing podcast episodes to text, we will utilize cloud-based speech-to-text services like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or IBM Watson Speech to Text. These services offer high accuracy in transcription and are capable of handling different accents and dialects, making them ideal for processing a wide variety of podcast content.

## NLP Techniques for Summarization and Highlight Generation

### 1. Text Preprocessing
We will begin by preprocessing the transcribed text to clean and standardize the data. This will involve:
- Tokenization: Breaking the text into individual words or tokens.
- Stop-word removal: Filtering out common words that do not contribute to the meaning.
- Text normalization: Techniques like stemming or lemmatization to standardize words.
- Vectorization: Using methods like Word2Vec or GloVe for uniform text representation.

### 2. Key Point Identification
To identify the most important aspects of the podcast content, we will apply the following NLP techniques:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Using pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa to identify and categorize significant entities in the text, such as people, locations, and topics.
- **Topic Modeling (LDA)**: Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to detect the main topics in the podcast content. We may also experiment with alternatives like Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for better coherence.
- **Keyword Extraction (TF-IDF)**: Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis to extract key phrases and words that reflect the essence of the podcast.

### 3. Summarization
We will leverage advanced transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT, which excel at understanding and generating text. These models will be fine-tuned with summarization-specific datasets to produce concise summaries that capture the critical points of each podcast episode.

### 4. Highlight Generation
To generate highlights, we will:
- Score sentences based on their relevance to key points using methods like embedding similarity and graph centrality.
- Use algorithms like PageRank to select the most important sentences that summarize the podcast's core themes.
These highlights will serve as brief, easy-to-read summaries, helping users quickly assess the podcast's content.

### 5. Iterative Refinement
We plan to iteratively refine the summarization and highlight generation processes based on user feedback and performance metrics. This will allow us to continuously improve the relevance and quality of the outputs.

## Related Work

This project builds on existing research in automatic podcast summarization and highlight generation. We will reference the following papers:
1. **MATeR (Multimodal Audio-Text Regressor)**: This paper explores an end-to-end deep learning architecture for predicting relevance scores of sentences in transcripts. It provides valuable insights into how to integrate audio and text for summarization.

These papers will guide the refinement of our approach to podcast summarization and highlight generation.

## Assessment Methodology

We will evaluate the performance of our system using various metrics:
- **F1 Score**: To measure the balance between precision and recall.
- **Precision and Recall**: To assess the relevance of generated summaries and highlights.
- **Fisher Scores (MFCC, loudness, F2, F3)**: To evaluate audio features in terms of the clarity and significance of the podcast content.
- **ROUGE Metric**: To measure the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary, including unigram, bigram, and longest common subsequence (LCS).
- **Semantic Similarity (BERT-based Sentence Similarity)**: To assess the degree of semantic similarity between sentences and the key points in the podcast.

## Future Work

As we iterate on the project, future improvements will focus on enhancing the accuracy of the key point identification, refining the highlight generation process, and exploring new ways to evaluate podcast content. We also plan to develop a user-friendly interface that will allow users to easily interact with the system and provide feedback.
